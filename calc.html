                What is Lorem Ipsum?
                
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            <h2>How I'd like to extend this in the future</h2>
            <p>
                My next goal is to make the calculator draggable. I'd then like to make it a browser extension, so users can have a draggable calculator on a webpage. Currently if I want to do this, I need to use the calculator app which disappears once I click on the actual webpage. I'd also like to have a button on the calculator to make notes, with the saved calculation and a link to the website. I think this could be a fun project to build beyond the utilit of a calculator.
